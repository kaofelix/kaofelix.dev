I don't want to talk a lot about
[Analogue: A Hate Story](http://ahatestory.com). Mostly because of how
I perceived my being completely oblivious to what the game was really
about improved the experience of playing it.

So instead of treading cautiously in quasi spoiler territory, I will
limit myself to recommend that you play it. Go with an open mind and
don't expect much in terms of game play. It's a Visual Novel, and one
quite deserving of the title "novel". Don't be fooled by the cheery
anime look of the characters, the underlying subject treated is
serious and it has historical backing — i.e. it's based on what was
once real, not completely made up —, which makes it more impacting as
you put the pieces together.

In a related note, the game is developed using
[Renpy](http://www.renpy.org), a visual novel engine written in
Python. It's not because I'm a Python fan and I'm not even that much
into Visual Novels, but I love Renpy and how accessible it makes for
anyone to create this particular kind of game.

Since I've seen Renpy I had this feeling that something really
impressive could be done in the form of a Visual Novel. Analogue, to me,
is a proof of this.
