    <p>
      I'm a parent and I have a dog. I work as a Software Developer and I love
      music, video games, art, and programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work for <a href="https://sahaj.ai">Sahaj Software</a>, a
      software consultancy company, where I help clients to build and maintain
      different sorts of application.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will do most of my work in <a
        href="https://github.com/kaofelix/kao-emacs-config">Emacs</a
      >, with few exceptions. I'm a fan of Python for it's combination of
      simplicity and pragmatism, which I would say is the language that I'm most
      fluent on, but I will take on any language or technology that is necessary
      to get the job done.
