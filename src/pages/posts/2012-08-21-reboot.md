I stopped feeling good about restarting blogs a while ago. Always
feels like it's a compensation for not having anything to say. Anyway,
I feel the need to restart. I'm not excited about posting in blogger
anymore. I'm annoyed by the interface lately and I dislike the whole
experience of trying to adapt it's templates to what I want. In
addition to that, I want something cool and fresh to tinker with, so
I'm going with the static generated blog bandwagon; not because it's
inherently better, but because I have fun with it.

There's a lot of what I would call fun in this approach:
* Playing with the latest &mdash; or so &mdash; on HTML 5 and CSS
* Finding a nice work flow for posting blogs from my Emacs
* Having a place online for content that's more than just blog posts
* General tinkering

So that's it, a new start. Again.
