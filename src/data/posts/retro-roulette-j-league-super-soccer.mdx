I grew up with emulators and as a teenager I would explore libraries of consoles that I had limited or no access too. Some years ago, I revisited this past by setting a up a RetroPie and that's when I first noticed RetroArch's "random choice" function. This sparked the idea that it would be really cool to just explore retro libraries randomly and see what kind of game I would find there. This idea came back to me recently and I casually mentioned in a group of friends, that if I was ever to start streaming, this would be a channel I would make. Then one [friend](https://tnaires.github.io/horizons/) asked "Why don't you blog about it?". What a great idea! I already have this space and writing posts is a lot easier for me.

## Welcome to Retro Roulette

So, welcome to the very first Retro Roulette! I'm setting a few rules to make it more fun to follow, which I will certainly tweak as I go along:

1. Only games that I haven't player before
2. Do a blind play to get to know the game
3. Do a second play after a bit more research

To start I decided to go for the SNES library and I got [_J. League Super Soccer_](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2105-virtual-soccer) (aka Virtual Soccer in its western release) from 1994.

Despite being Brazilian, I'm not much of a football fan. I kind of liked playing it as a kid, but I was not very good, which made a bit more difficult to enjoy as I would frequently receive abuse from some of the more "dedicated" team members (aka assholes). However, I did enjoy playing some FIFA 96-98 in the Mega Drive and International Super Star Soccer in the SNES when growing up. But I think my liking of football games started waning around the time Winning Eleven on the PS1 was at it's peak in my social circle and I never played any beyond that, not even modern FIFA, which seems to be the dominant series now. Either way, I feel like I can definitely engage with a game like J. League Super Soccer in a fun experiment setting like this.

## First Play

So I boot up the game and the very first thing that called my attention was the [opening sequence and its song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNfRGde1lUI). It starts with the little trumpet riff, then the rhythmic synthesized claps and cheers until finally the bass drops and the classic roots & fifths bassline comes fully into play, that lightens up paths through my synapses forged in night clubs dancing to [Standing in the Way of Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn043ArR98M) bringing back some party bliss from years gone.

As I take in the music, I start screen recording and reset the game to capture the opening in full, before diving in. I'm greeted with a few options and I press one of them and land directly in the team choices. Without realising at the moment, I pick up the Kashima Antlers (ÈπøÂ≥∂„Ç¢„É≥„Éà„É©„Éº„Ç∫) while trying to find which button would take me back to the menu to have another look at the options. Another mispress makes me select the Verdy Kawasaki („É¥„Çß„É´„Éá„Ç£Â∑ùÂ¥é) as the opposing team and suddenly I'm in the formation screen.

As I try to navigate this screen I change some options randomly from Auto to Manual. No idea what they are meant to be at the time, but I learn after that they are the goal keeper control mode. After that, there's a coin toss screen that just goes a bit too fast for me to understand what's going on. I think the result is against me, since the cursor moves on its own while the CPU controlled Verdys picked up the side of the field they wanted to start in while I got the first kick off. Finally I'm playing football!

The view of the field is top down and vertical with goals being towards the top and bottom ends of the screen. I really dig the dynamic zooming in and out of the field. I guess this is the famous Mode 7 working its magic, but I don't know enough about the tech to be 100% sure.

While playing, I have no idea what I'm doing. When I don't have the ball, I have no idea on how to get it back. I randomly press between Y, A and B and they all seem to go into a slide tackle, but even with this very aggressive technique, I fail to steal the ball even once. I can't even cause a foul. It's also a movement that costs a lot of cooldown time, leaving my player stuck and the way free for the opposing team attackers. There's a barrage of goal kicks from them, my goalie is actually pretty decent at catching most of them automatically, only for me to kick the ball away somehow 90% of the time directly at the feet of an opposing team player.

Eventually they score the first goal, proceeding to score 9 more, leaving this first match to be a whopping 10x0 in their favour. While I can't steal the ball or even hit one of their players with my sliding tackles, they are constantly doing fouls agains my player *without* the sliding tackle. They take constant yellow cards and eventually two red ones. One of my players has to leave the field eventually injured. It's a carnage all while they mock me with their celebration dance.

## It's an Eternal 7x1

Next evening I went back to J. League Super Soccer to learn more about the game. I skimmed the manuals for both [the original Japanese version](https://archive.org/details/j.-league-super-soccer-shvc-vx-sfc-jp-manual-600-dpi) as well as it's western release [Virtual Soccer](https://archive.org/details/virtual-soccer-pal) that I found in the Internet Archive. So I learned that when you're holding the ball B shoots and you can either tap it or hold it for sending the ball different lengths. Either Y or A are the pass button, which will pass the ball to the player that has a square mark over their head and I can switch players with L and R. X is used for an intentional foul attempt whether you are holding the ball or not. A-ha! So that's what they were doing to me!

I also discover how to navigate the menu where you can flip each row of "cards" to access different modes and options. There's even a side mode, which changes the perspective to something more similar to International Super Star Soccer or even modern FIFA games (which, well, is how football also plays on TV). I don't use it though, since I quite like the top down view for how different if feels from other games I played. I do use the practice mode for a bit to try and get a bit more used to the controls I just learned. It's a weird mode, since it's only your team on the field and you can practice shooting against your own goalie, which will try to defend against your players, or shoot at an empty goal, which was more difficult to hit than I initially anticipated.

Finally, I go to play again. I choose the same teams again (which I now realise are just the first choices anyway). My tendency with games is that I tend to try again and again the same basic combinations before I start exploring too much. I want to get back to playing as fast as possible, so that also helps if I just go for the defaults. So it's Kagoshima Antlers vs Verdy Kawasaki again.

After reading the instructions and have played it once, I'm slightly more competent. I lose the second match by only 3x0 and even manage to attempt a few goals. I'm better at defense and also learn that when I pass the ball, I need to let goal of the d-pad for a moment, or I will start moving the receiving player before the ball reaches them. This match has me fired up, so I quickly go for another attempt.

I end up taking a lot more goals this time, but I manage to score my first--and only--one! It was a weird one at that, since I just zig zagged through the field, dribbling the whole defense and their goalie right up to the goal line which resulted in an opposing player scoring an own goal it in in their attempt to take the ball back.

I got excited thinking I found my secret technique, but it was just a fluke--I failed to ever do it again. The match ended up 7x1 to my opponents, like Brazil's shameful defeat against Germany in the 2014 World Cup.

I kept playing a few more matches, and it was way more fun than I expected to engage in earnest with this old football game. The CPU is a bit too hard for a beginner, so it would have been nicer to have played against a friend with a similar skill level. I might go back to play it a few more times, maybe even try the sequel to see in which way they might have improved it. But for kicking off this series, I think that fits the kind of exploration I'm looking for!

Now I'm ready to see what the roulette brings me next!
